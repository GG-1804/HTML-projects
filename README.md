# HTML-projects
All my HTML projects will be uploaded here
At its core, this website serves as a platform to display two of my fundamental HTML projects: the Movie Recommendation project and the Birthday Invite project. These projects not only demonstrate my proficiency in HTML but also highlight my ability to create engaging and interactive web experiences.

The Movie Recommendation project is designed to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences. With a user-friendly interface and intuitive design, this project aims to enhance the user's movie-watching experience by suggesting films tailored to their tastes.

On the other hand, the Birthday Invite project offers a fun and creative way to send out invitations for special occasions. Featuring customizable templates and interactive elements, this project allows users to craft unique invitations that capture the spirit of celebration.

Through this portfolio website, I hope to showcase my skills as a web developer while providing visitors with a glimpse into my creative process and dedication to learning. Join me on this journey as I continue to explore the endless possibilities of web development and design.
